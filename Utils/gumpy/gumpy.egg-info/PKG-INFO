Description: EEG signal processing and classification toolbox.
        
        This toolbox provides signal processing functions and classes to work with BCI
        datasets. Many of the functions internally call existing libraries for signal
        processing or numerical computation such as ``numpy`` or ``scipy``. In these
        cases the functions are called with parameters that were found to be suitable
        for BCI computing and brain machine interfaces.
        
        The name of the toolbox is a reference to the Gumby Brain Specialist sketch by
        Monty Python.
